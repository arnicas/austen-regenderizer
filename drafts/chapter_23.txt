Chapter 24 Miss Bingley 's letter arrived , and put an end to doubt .
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter , and concluded with her her brother 's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his his friends in Hertfordshire before she left the country .
Hope was over , entirely over ; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort . Miss Darcy 's praise occupied the chief of it . Her many attractions were again dwelt on , and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter . She wrote also with great pleasure of her her brother 's being an inmate of Mrs. Darcy 's house   's house , and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture . Elizabeth , to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation . Her heart was divided between concern for her her sister , and resentment against all others .
To Caroline 's assertion of her her brother 's being partial to Miss Darcy he paid no credit .
That he was really fond of Jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done ; and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution , which now made him the slave of his his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination .
Had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best , but her her sister 's was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible herself .
It was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing . She could think of nothing else ; and yet whether Bingley 's regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his his friends ' interference ; whether he had been aware of Jane 's attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation ; whatever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her her brother 's situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded .
A day or two passed before John had courage to speak of him feelings to Elizabeth ; but at last , on Mrs. Bennet 's leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master , she could not help saying : `` Oh , that my dear mother had more command over herself ! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him .
But I will not repine .
It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . '' Elizabeth looked at her her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing .
`` You doubt me , '' cried Jane , slightly colouring ; `` indeed , you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable woman of my acquaintance , but that is all .
I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach her with .
Thank God !
I have not _ that _ pain .
A little time , therefore -- I shall certainly try to get the better . ''
With a stronger voice he soon added , `` I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself . ''
`` My dear John ! '' exclaimed Edward , `` you are too good .
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you .
I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . '' Mr. Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on his  brother 's warm affection .
`` Nay , '' said Edward , `` this is not fair .
_ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody .
_ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it .
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will .
You need not .
There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well .
The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense .
I have met with two instances lately , one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage .
It is unaccountable !
In every view it is unaccountable ! ''
`` My dear Eddie , do not give way to such feelings as these .
They will ruin your happiness .
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper .
Consider Mr. Collins 's respectability , and Charlotte 's steady , prudent character .
Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for everybody 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . ''
`` To oblige you , I would try to believe almost anything , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart . My dear John , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow-minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who married him him can not have a proper way of thinking .
You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas .
You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger security for happiness . ''
`` I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , '' replied John ; `` and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together .
But enough of this .
You alluded to something else .
You mentioned _ two _ instances .
I can not misunderstand you , but I entreat you , dear Eddie , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of her is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young woman to be always so guarded and circumspect .
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . ''
`` And men take care that they should . ''
`` If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . ''
`` I am far from attributing any part of Miss Bingley 's conduct to design , '' said Edward ; `` but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery .
Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . ''
`` And do you impute it to either of those ? ''
`` Yes ; to the last .
But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem .
Stop me whilst you can . ''
`` You persist , then , in supposing her  sisters influence her ? ''
`` Yes , in conjunction with her  friend . ''
`` I can not believe it .
Why should they try to influence her ?
They can only wish her happiness ; and if she is attached to me , no other man can secure it . ''
`` Your first position is false .
They may wish many things besides her happiness ; they may wish her increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish her to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . ''
`` Beyond a doubt , they do wish her to choose Miss Darcy , '' replied John ; `` but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing .
They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better .
But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their sister 's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ?
If they believed her attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if she were so , they could not succeed .
By supposing such an affection , you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy .
Do not distress me by the idea .
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is light , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of her or her  sisters .
Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . '' Edward could not oppose such a wish ; and from this time Miss Bingley 's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them . Mr. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at her returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which Edward did not account for it clearly , there was little chance of him ever considering it with less perplexity . His  son endeavoured to convince him of what he did not believe himself , that her attentions to John had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when she saw him no more ; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , he had the same story to repeat every day . Mr. Bennet 's best comfort was that Miss Bingley must be down again in the summer . Mrs. Bennet treated the matter differently .
`` So , Eddie , '' said she one day , `` your brother is crossed in love , I find .
I congratulate him .
Next to being married , a boy likes to be crossed a little in love now and then .
It is something to think of , and it gives him a sort of distinction among his  companions .
When is your turn to come ?
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by John .
Now is your time .
Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young gentlemen in the country  .
Let Wickham be your man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . ''
`` Thank you , madam , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect John 's good fortune . ''
`` True , '' said Mrs. Bennet , `` but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you , you have an affectionate father who will make the most of it . '' Mr. Wickham 's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family .
They saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve .
The whole of what Edward had already heard , his claims on Miss Darcy , and all that he had suffered from her , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed ; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Miss Darcy before they had known anything of the matter . Mr. Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of Hertfordshire ; him mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes -- but by everybody else Miss Darcy was condemned as the worst of women .
