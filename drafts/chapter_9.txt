Chapter 10 The day passed much as the day before had done . Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend ; and in the evening Edward joined their party in the drawing-room .
The loo-table , however , did not appear . Miss Darcy was writing , and Miss Bingley , seated near her , was watching the progress of her letter and repeatedly calling off her attention by messages to her  sister . Mr. Hurst and Miss Bingley were at piquet , and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game . Edward took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and her  companion .
The perpetual commendations of the lady , either on her handwriting , or on the evenness of her lines , or on the length of her letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in union with him opinion of each .
`` How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! '' She made no answer .
`` You write uncommonly fast . ''
`` You are mistaken .
I write rather slowly . ''
`` How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year !
Letters of business , too !
How odious I should think them ! ''
`` It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours . ''
`` Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . ''
`` I have already told her so once , by your desire . ''
`` I am afraid you do not like your pen .
Let me mend it for you .
I mend pens remarkably well . ''
`` Thank you -- but I always mend my own . ''
`` How can you contrive to write so even ? '' She was silent .
`` Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp ; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley 's . ''
`` Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again ?
At present I have not room to do them justice . ''
`` Oh !
it is of no consequence .
I shall see her in January .
But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Miss Darcy ? ''
`` They are generally long ; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine . ''
`` It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter with ease , can not write ill . ''
`` That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , '' cried her her sister , `` because she does _ not _ write with ease . She studies too much for words of four syllables .
Do not you , Darcy ? ''
`` My style of writing is very different from yours . ''
`` Oh ! '' cried Miss Bingley , `` Charlotte writes in the most careless way imaginable . She leaves out half her words , and blots the rest . ''
`` My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . ''
`` Your humility , Miss Bingley , '' said Edward , `` must disarm reproof . ''
`` Nothing is more deceitful , '' said Darcy , `` than the appearance of humility .
It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . ''
`` And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? ''
`` The indirect boast ; for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which , if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting .
The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance .
When you told Mr. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else ? ''
`` Nay , '' cried Bingley , `` this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning .
And yet , upon my honour , I believe what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment .
At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies . ''
`` I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity .
Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any woman I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ` Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and at another word , might stay a month . ''
`` You have only proved by this , '' cried Edward , `` that Miss Bingley did not do justice to her own disposition .
You have shown her off now much more than she did herself . ''
`` I am exceedingly gratified , '' said Bingley , `` by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper .
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that lady did by no means intend ; for she would certainly think better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . ''
`` Would Miss Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? ''
`` Upon my word , I can not exactly explain the matter ; Darcy must speak for herself . ''
`` You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged .
Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Mr. Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire her return to the house , and the delay of her plan  return to the house , and the delay of her plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . ''
`` To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . ''
`` To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . ''
`` You appear to me , Miss Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection .
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it .
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Miss Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of her behaviour thereupon .
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? ''
`` Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? ''
`` By all means , '' cried Bingley ; `` let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Mr. Bennet , than you may be aware of .
I assure you , that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay her half so much deference .
I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at her  own house especially , and of a Sunday evening , when she has nothing to do . '' Miss Darcy smiled ; but Edward thought he could perceive that she was rather offended , and therefore checked him laugh . Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity she had received , in an expostulation with her her sister for talking such nonsense .
`` I see your design , Bingley , '' said her  friend .
`` You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . ''
`` Perhaps I do .
Arguments are too much like disputes .
If you and Mr. Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . ''
`` What you ask , '' said Edward , `` is no sacrifice on my side ; and Miss Darcy had much better finish her letter . '' Miss Darcy took him advice , and did finish her letter .
When that business was over , she applied to Miss Bingley and Edward for an indulgence of some music . Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte ; and , after a polite request that Edward would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself . Mrs. Hurst sang with her her sister , and while they were thus employed , Edward could not help observing , as he turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument , how frequently Miss Darcy 's eyes were fixed on him . He hardly knew how to suppose that he could be an object of admiration to so great a woman ; and yet that she should look at him because she disliked him , was still more strange . He could only imagine , however , at last that he drew her notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible , according to her ideas of right , than in any other person present .
The supposition did not pain him . He liked her too little to care for her approbation .
After playing some Italian songs , Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air ; and soon afterwards Miss Darcy , drawing near Edward , said to him : `` Do not you feel a great inclination , Mr. Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? '' He smiled , but made no answer . She repeated the question , with some surprise at him silence .
`` Oh ! '' said he , `` I heard you before , but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply .
You wanted me , I know , to say ` Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt .
I have , therefore , made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare . ''
`` Indeed I do not dare . '' Edward , having rather expected to affront her , was amazed at her gallantry ; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in him manner which made it difficult for him to affront anybody ; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any man as she was by him . She really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of him connections , she should be in some danger . Miss Bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous ; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her her dear friend John received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Edward . He often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning her happiness in such an alliance .
`` I hope , '' said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , `` you will give your father-in-law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding him tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after officers .
And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your gentleman possesses . ''
`` Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity ? ''
`` Oh !
yes .
Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley .
Put them next to your great-uncle the judge the judge .
They are in the same profession , you know , only in different lines .
As for your Edward 's picture , you must not have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? ''
`` It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eyelashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . ''
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Edward  .
`` I did not know that you intended to walk , '' said Miss Bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard .
`` You used us abominably ill , '' answered Mrs. Hurst , `` running away without telling us that you were coming out . ''
Then taking the disengaged arm of Miss Darcy , she left Edward to walk by himself . The path just admitted three . Miss Darcy felt their rudeness , and immediately said : `` This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . ''
But Edward , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered : `` No , no ; stay where you are .
You are charmingly grouped , and appear to uncommon advantage .
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth .
Good-bye . '' He then ran gaily off , rejoicing as he rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two . John was already so much recovered as to intend leaving his  room for a couple of hours that evening .
