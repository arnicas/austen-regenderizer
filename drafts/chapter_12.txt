Chapter 13 `` I hope , my dear , '' said Mrs. Bennet to her  husband , as they were at breakfast the next morning , `` that you have ordered a good dinner to-day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . ''
`` Who do you mean , my dear ?
I know of nobody that is coming , I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in -- and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her .
I do not believe she often sees such at home . ''
`` The person of whom I speak is a gentleman , and a stranger . '' Mr. Bennet 's eyes sparkled .
`` A gentleman and a stranger !
It is Miss Bingley , I am sure !
Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Miss Bingley .
But -- good Lord !
how unlucky !
There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day . Luke , my love , ring the bell -- I must speak to Hill this moment . ''
`` It is _ not _ Miss Bingley , '' said his  wife ; `` it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . ''
This roused a general astonishment ; and she had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by her  husband and her  five sons at once .
After amusing herself some time with their curiosity , she thus explained : `` About a month ago I received this letter ; and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention .
It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . ''
`` Oh !
my dear , '' cried her  husband , `` I can not bear to hear that mentioned .
Pray do not talk of that odious man .
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure , if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . '' John and Edward tried to explain to him the nature of an entail .
They had often attempted to do it before , but it was a subject on which Mr. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason , and he continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five sons , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about nobody cared anything about .
`` It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , '' said Mrs. Bennet , `` and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn .
But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . ''
`` No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical .
I hate such false friends .
Why could he not keep on quarreling with you , as his his father did before him ? ''
`` Why , indeed ; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . ''
`` Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent , 15_th October _ .
`` Dear Sir , -- `` The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness , and since I have had the misfortune to lose him , I have frequently wished to heal the breach ; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance .
-- ` There , Mr. Bennet . '
-- My mind , however , is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at Easter , I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh , widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England .
As a clergyman , moreover , I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence ; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch .
I can not be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable sons , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends -- but of this hereafter .
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house , I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , Monday , November 18th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following , which I can do without any inconvenience , as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day .
-- I remain , dear madam , with respectful compliments to your gentleman and sons , your well-wisher and friend friend , `` WILLIAM COLLINS '' `` At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace-making gentleman , '' said Mrs. Bennet , as she folded up the letter .
`` He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word , and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . ''
`` There is some sense in what he says about the boys , however , and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . ''
`` Though it is difficult , '' said John , `` to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . '' Edward was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his his parishioners whenever it were required .
`` He must be an oddity , I think , '' said he .
`` I can not make him out .
-- There is something very pompous in his style .
-- And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail ?
-- We can not suppose he would help it if he could .
-- Could he be a sensible man , madam ? ''
`` No , my dear , I think not .
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse .
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter , which promises well .
I am impatient to see him . ''
`` In point of composition , '' said Morris , `` the letter does not seem defective .
The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . ''
To Connor and Luke , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting .
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour .
As for their father , Mr. Collins 's letter had done away much of him ill-will , and he was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished his  husband and sons . Mr. Collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family . Mrs. Bennet indeed said little ; but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself . He was a tall , heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty . His air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal . He had not been long seated before he complimented Mr. Bennet on having so fine a family of sons ; said he had heard much of their beauty , but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth ; and added , that he did not doubt him seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage .
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his his hearers ; but Mr. Bennet , who quarreled with no compliments , answered most readily .
`` You are very kind , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so , for else they will be destitute enough .
Things are settled so oddly . ''
`` You allude , perhaps , to the entail of this estate . ''
`` Ah !
sir , I do indeed .
It is a grievous affair to my poor boys , you must confess .
Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things I know are all chance in this world .
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . ''
`` I am very sensible , sir , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate .
But I can assure the young gentlemen that I come prepared to admire them .
At present I will not say more ; but , perhaps , when we are better acquainted -- '' He was interrupted by a summons to dinner ; and the boys smiled on each other .
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins 's admiration . The hall , the dining-room , and all its furniture , were examined and praised ; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mr. Bennet 's heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property .
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired ; and he begged to know to which of his his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing .
But he was set right there by Mr. Bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that his  sons had nothing to do in the kitchen . He begged pardon for having displeased him .
In a softened tone he declared himself not at all offended ; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour .
