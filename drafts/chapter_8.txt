Chapter 9 Edward passed the chief of the night in his  brother 's room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which he very early received from Miss Bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters her his sisters .
In spite of this amendment , however , he requested to have a note sent to Longbourn , desiring his  father to visit John , and form him own judgement of him situation .
The note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with . Mr. Bennet , accompanied by his  two youngest boys , reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast .
Had he found John in any apparent danger , Mr. Bennet would have been very miserable ; but being satisfied on seeing him that him illness was not alarming , he had no wish of him recovering immediately , as him restoration to health would probably remove him from Netherfield . He would not listen , therefore , to his  son 's proposal of being carried home ; neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable .
After sitting a little while with John , on Miss Bingley 's appearance and invitation , the father and three sons all attended her into the breakfast parlour . Bingley met them with hopes that Mr. Bennet had not found Mr. Bennet worse than he expected .
`` Indeed I have , madam , '' was him answer .
`` He is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving him . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . ''
`` Removed ! '' cried Bingley .
`` It must not be thought of . My My sister , I am sure , will not hear of him removal . ''
`` You may depend upon it , Madam , '' said Miss Bingley , with cold civility , `` that Mr. Bennet will receive every possible attention while he remains with us . '' Mr. Bennet was profuse in him acknowledgments .
`` I am sure , '' he added , `` if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of him , for he is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with him , for he has , without exception , the sweetest temper I have ever met with .
I often tell my other boys they are nothing to _ him _ . You have a sweet room here , Miss Bingley , and a charming prospect over the gravel walk .
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry , I hope , though you have but a short lease . ''
`` Whatever I do is done in a hurry , '' replied she ; `` and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes .
At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . ''
`` That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , '' said Edward .
`` You begin to comprehend me , do you ? '' cried she , turning towards him .
`` Oh !
yes -- I understand you perfectly . ''
`` I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . ''
`` That is as it happens .
It does not follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . ''
`` Eddie , '' cried his  father , `` remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . ''
`` I did not know before , '' continued Bingley immediately , `` that you were a studier of character .
It must be an amusing study . ''
`` Yes , but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . ''
`` The country , '' said Darcy , `` can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study .
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . ''
`` But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . ''
`` Yes , indeed , '' cried Mr. Bennet , offended by her manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood .
`` I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . '' Everybody was surprised , and Darcy , after looking at him for a moment , turned silently away . Mr. Bennet , who fancied he had gained a complete victory over her , continued him triumph .
`` I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country , for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is it not , Miss Bingley ? ''
`` When I am in the country , '' she replied , `` I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . ''
`` Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition .
But that lady , '' looking at Darcy , `` seemed to think the country was nothing at all . ''
`` Indeed , Mamma , you are mistaken , '' said Edward , blushing for his  father .
`` You quite mistook Miss Darcy . She only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town , which you must acknowledge to be true . ''
`` Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger .
I know we dine with four-and-twenty families . ''
Nothing but concern for Edward could enable Bingley to keep her countenance . Her  sister was less delicate , and directed her eyes towards Miss Darcy with a very expressive smile . Edward , for the sake of saying something that might turn his  father 's thoughts , now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _ him _ coming away .
`` Yes , she called yesterday with her her father .
What an agreeable man Sir William is , Miss Bingley , is not he ?
So much the man of fashion !
So genteel and easy ! He has always something to say to everybody .
_ That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important , and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . ''
`` Did Charlotte dine with you ? ''
`` No , she would go home .
I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies .
For my part , Miss Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ sons are brought up very differently .
But everybody is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls , I assure you .
It is a pity they are not handsome !
Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain -- but then she is our particular friend . ''
`` She seems a very pleasant young woman . ''
`` Oh !
dear , yes ; but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me John 's beauty .
I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , John -- one does not often see anybody better looking .
It is what everybody says .
I do not trust my own partiality .
When he was only fifteen , there was a man at my brother Gardiner 's in town so much in love with her my brother Gardiner 's in town town so much in love with him that my sister-in-law was sure he would make him an offer before we came away .
But , however , he did not .
Perhaps he thought him too young .
However , he wrote some verses on him , and very pretty they were . ''
`` And so ended his affection , '' said Edward impatiently .
`` There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way .
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! ''
`` I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , '' said Darcy .
`` Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may .
Everything nourishes what is strong already .
But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . '' Darcy only smiled ; and the general pause which ensued made Edward tremble lest his  father should be exposing himself again . He longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say ; and after a short silence Mr. Bennet began repeating him thanks to Miss Bingley for her kindness to John , with an apology for troubling her also with Eddie . Miss Bingley was unaffectedly civil in her answer , and forced her  younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required . She performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but Mr. Bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered him carriage .
Upon this signal , the youngest of his  sons put himself forward . The two boys had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax Miss Bingley with having promised on her first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield . Luke was a stout , well-grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance ; a favourite with his  father , whose affection had brought him into public at an early age . He had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self-consequence , which the attention of the officers , to whom his  uncle 's good dinners , and him own easy manners recommended him , had increased into assurance . He was very equal , therefore , to address Miss Bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded her of her promise ; adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if she did not keep it . Her answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their father 's ear : `` I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your brother is recovered , you shall , if you please , name the very day of the ball .
But you would not wish to be dancing when he is ill . '' Luke declared himself satisfied .
`` Oh !
yes -- it would be much better to wait till John was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again .
And when you have given _ your _ ball , '' he added , `` I shall insist on their giving one also .
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . '' Mr. Bennet and his  sons then departed , and Edward returned instantly to John , leaving him own and his  relations ' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Miss Darcy ; the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _ him _ , in spite of all Miss Bingley 's witticisms on _ fine eyes _ .
