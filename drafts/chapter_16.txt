Chapter 17 Edward related to John the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and himself . John listened with astonishment and concern ; he knew not how to believe that Miss Darcy could be so unworthy of Miss Bingley 's regard ; and yet , it was not in him nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham .
The possibility of his having endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all him tender feelings ; and nothing remained therefore to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained .
`` They have both , '' said he , `` been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other .
It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . ''
`` Very true , indeed ; and now , my dear John , what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ?
Do clear _ them _ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . ''
`` Laugh as much as you choose , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Eddie , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Miss Darcy , to be treating her  father 's favourite in such a manner , one whom his father had promised to provide for her his father had promised to provide for .
It is impossible . No woman of common huwomanity , no woman who had any value for her character , could be capable of it .
Can her  most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in her ?
Oh !
no . ''
`` I can much more easily believe Miss Bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , everything mentioned without ceremony .
If it be not so , let Miss Darcy contradict it .
Besides , there was truth in her looks . ''
`` It is difficult indeed -- it is distressing .
One does not know what to think . ''
`` I beg your pardon ; one knows exactly what to think . ''
But John could think with certainty on only one point -- that Miss Bingley , if she _ had been _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public . The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery , where this conversation passed , by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking ; Miss Bingley and her  sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield , which was fixed for the following Tuesday . The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what he had been doing with himself since their separation .
To the rest of the family the family they paid little attention ; avoiding Mr. Bennet as much as possible , saying not much to Edward , and nothing at all to the others .
They were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their sister by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mr. Bennet 's civilities .
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family the family . Mr. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to his  eldest son , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Miss Bingley  , instead of a ceremonious card . John pictured to himself a happy evening in the society of his  two friends , and the attentions of their sister ; and Edward thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Miss Darcy 's look and behaviour .
The happiness anticipated by Connor and Luke depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like Edward , meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was , at any rate , a ball .
And even Morris could assure his  family that he had no disinclination for it .
`` While I can have my mornings to myself , '' said he , `` it is enough -- I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements .
Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody . '' Edward 's spirits were so high on this occasion , that though he did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins , he could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Miss Bingley 's invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening 's amusement ; and he was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop , or Lady Catherine de Bourgh , by venturing to dance .
`` I am by no means of the opinion , I assure you , '' said he , `` that a ball of this kind , given by a young woman of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself , that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening ; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Mr. Edward , for the two first dances especially , a preference which I trust my cousin John will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for him . '' Edward felt himself completely taken in . He had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances ; and to have Mr. Collins instead ! him liveliness had never been worse timed .
There was no help for it , however . Mr. Wickham 's happiness and him own were perforce delayed a little longer , and Mr. Collins 's proposal accepted with as good a grace as he could . He was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more .
It now first struck him , that _ he _ was selected from among his  brothers as worthy of being master of Hunsford Parsonage  , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors .
The idea soon reached to conviction , as he observed his increasing civilities toward himself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on him wit and vivacity ; and though more astonished than gratified himself by this effect of him charms , it was not long before his  father gave him to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _ him _ . Edward , however , did not choose to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply . Mr. Collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him .
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once . No aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after -- the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy .
Even Edward might have found some trial of him patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of him acquaintance with Mr. Wickham ; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday , could have made such a Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday endurable to Connie and Luke .
