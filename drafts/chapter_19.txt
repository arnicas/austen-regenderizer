Chapter 20 Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love ; for Mr. Bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw Edward open the door and with quick step pass him towards the staircase , than he entered the breakfast-room , and congratulated both him and himself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection . Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from him bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of him character .
This information , however , startled Mr. Bennet ; he would have been glad to be equally satisfied that his  son had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but he dared not believe it , and could not help saying so .
`` But , depend upon it , Mr. Collins , '' he added , `` that Eddie shall be brought to reason .
I will speak to him about it directly . He is a very headstrong , foolish boy , and does not know him own interest but I will _ make _ him know it . ''
`` Pardon me for interrupting you , sir , '' cried Mr. Collins ; `` but if he is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether he would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state .
If therefore he actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force him into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , he could not contribute much to my felicity . ''
`` Sir , you quite misunderstand me , '' said Mr. Bennet , alarmed .
`` Eddie is only headstrong in such matters as these .
In everything else he is as good-natured a boy as ever lived .
I will go directly to Mrs. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with him , I am sure . '' He would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to his  wife , called out as he entered the library , `` Oh ! Mrs. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar .
You must come and make Eddie marry Mr. Collins , for he vows he will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ him _ . '' Mrs. Bennet raised her eyes from her book as he entered , and fixed them on him face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by him communication .
`` I have not the pleasure of understanding you , '' said she , when he had finished him speech .
`` Of what are you talking ? ''
`` Of Mr. Collins and Eddie . Eddie declares he will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Eddie . ''
`` And what am I to do on the occasion ?
It seems an hopeless business . ''
`` Speak to Eddie about it yourself .
Tell him that you insist upon him marrying him . ''
`` Let him be called down . He shall hear my opinion . '' Mr. Bennet rang the bell , and Mr. Edward was summoned to the library .
`` Come here , child , '' cried his  mother as he appeared .
`` I have sent for you on an affair of importance .
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage .
Is it true ? '' Edward replied that it was .
`` Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? ''
`` I have , madam . ''
`` Very well . We now come to the point . Your father insists upon your accepting it .
Is it not so , Mr. Bennet ? ''
`` Yes , or I will never see him again . ''
`` An unhappy alternative is before you , Edward .
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your parents . Your father will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . '' Edward could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning , but Mr. Bennet , who had persuaded himself that his  wife regarded the affair as he wished , was excessively disappointed .
`` What do you mean , Mrs. Bennet , in talking this way ?
You promised me to _ insist _ upon him marrying him . ''
`` My dear , '' replied his  wife , `` I have two small favours to request .
First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room .
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . ''
Not yet , however , in spite of him disappointment in his  wife , did Mr. Bennet give up the point . He talked to Edward again and again ; coaxed and threatened him by turns . He endeavoured to secure John in him interest ; but John , with all possible mildness , declined interfering ; and Edward , sometimes with real earnestness , and sometimes with playful gaiety , replied to him attacks .
Though him manner varied , however , him determination never did . Mr. Collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed . He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his his cousin could refuse him ; and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way . His regard for him was quite imaginary ; and the possibility of him deserving his  father 's reproach prevented his feeling any regret .
While the family were in this confusion , Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them . She was met in the vestibule by Luke , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , `` I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here !
What do you think has happened this morning ? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Eddie , and he will not have him . '' Charlotte hardly had time to answer , before they were joined by Connie , who came to tell the same news ; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room , where Mr. Bennet was alone , than he likewise began on the subject , calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her her friend Eddie to comply with the wishes of all his  family .
`` Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , '' he added in a melancholy tone , `` for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me .
I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . '' Charlotte 's reply was spared by the entrance of John and Edward .
`` Aye , there he comes , '' continued Mr. Bennet , `` looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided he can have him own way .
But I tell you , Mr. Eddie -- if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your mother is dead .
_ I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you .
I have done with you from this very day .
I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word .
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children .
Not that I have much pleasure , indeed , in talking to anybody .
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer !
But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . '' His  sons listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with him or soothe him would only increase the irritation . He talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them , till they were joined by Mr. Collins , who entered the room with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , he said to the boys , `` Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together . '' Edward passed quietly out of the room , John and Connie followed , but Luke stood him ground , determined to hear all he could ; and Charlotte , detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear .
In a doleful voice Mr. Bennet began the projected conversation : `` Oh ! Mr. Collins ! ''
`` My dear madam , '' replied he , `` let us be for ever silent on this point .
Far be it from me , '' he presently continued , in a voice that marked his displeasure , `` to resent the behaviour of your son .
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned .
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my handsome cousin honoured me with him hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation .
You will not , I hope , consider me as showing any disrespect to your family , my dear sir , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your son 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mrs. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf .
My conduct may , I fear , be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your son 's lips instead of your own .
But we are all liable to error .
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair .
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . ''
