Chapter 5 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate the Bennets were particularly intimate . Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune , and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his his mayoralty .
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly .
It had given him a disgust to his business , and to his his residence in a small market town a small market town ; and , in quitting them both , he had removed with his his family to a house about a mile from Meryton Meryton , denominated from that period Lucas Lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and , unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world .
For , though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious ; on the contrary , he was all attention to everybody .
By nature inoffensive , friendly , and obliging , his presentation at St. James 's had made him courteous . Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mr. Bennet .
They had several children .
The eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty-seven , was Edward  's intimate friend .
That the Miss Lucases and the Mr Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary ; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate .
`` _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , '' said Mr. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas .
`` _ You _ were Miss Bingley 's first choice . ''
`` Yes ; but she seemed to like her second better . ''
`` Oh !
you mean John , I suppose , because she danced with him twice .
To be sure that _ did _ seem as if she admired him -- indeed I rather believe she _ did _ -- I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . ''
`` Perhaps you mean what I overheard between her and Mr. Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson 's asking her how she liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether she did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ she thought the prettiest ?
and her answering immediately to the last question : ` Oh ! the eldest Mr. Bennet , beyond a doubt ; there can not be two opinions on that point .
''' `` Upon my word !
Well , that is very decided indeed -- that does seem as if -- but , however , it may all come to nothing , you know . ''
`` _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Ed , '' said Charlotte .
`` Miss Darcy is not so well worth listening to as her  friend , is she ?
-- poor Ed !
-- to be only just _ tolerable _ . ''
`` I beg you would not put it into Eddie 's head to be vexed by her ill-treatment , for she is such a disagreeable woman , that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by her . Mrs. Long told me last night that she sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening her lips . ''
`` Are you quite sure , sir ?
-- is not there a little mistake ? '' said John .
`` I certainly saw Miss Darcy speaking to her . ''
`` Aye -- because she asked her at last how he liked Netherfield , and she could not help answering her ; but she said she seemed quite angry at being spoke to . ''
`` Miss Bingley told me , '' said John , `` that she never speaks much , unless among her  intimate acquaintances .
With _ them _ she is remarkably agreeable . ''
`` I do not believe a word of it , my dear .
If she had been so very agreeable , she would have talked to Mrs. Long .
But I can guess how it was ; everybody says that she is eat up with pride , and I dare say she had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . ''
`` I do not mind her not talking to Mrs. Long , '' said Miss Lucas , `` but I wish she had danced with Ed . ''
`` Another time , Eddie , '' said his  father , `` I would not dance with _ her _ , if I were you . ''
`` I believe , sir , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with her . ''
`` Her pride , '' said Miss Lucas , `` does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it .
One can not wonder that so very fine a young woman , with family , fortune , everything in her favour , should think highly of herself .
If I may so express it , she has a _ right _ to be proud . ''
`` That is very true , '' replied Edward , `` and I could easily forgive _ her _ pride , if she had not mortified _ mine _ . ''
`` Pride , '' observed Morris , who piqued himself upon the solidity of him reflections , `` is a very common failing , I believe .
By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed ; that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary .
Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonymously . A person may be proud without being vain .
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . ''
`` If I were as rich as Miss Darcy , '' cried a young Lucas , who came with his his sisters , `` I should not care how proud I was .
I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine a day . ''
`` Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , '' said Mr. Bennet ; `` and if I were to see you at it , I should take away your bottle directly . '' The boy protested that he should not ; he continued to declare that he would , and the argument ended only with the visit .
