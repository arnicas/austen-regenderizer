Chapter 7 Mr. Bennet 's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for her  sons , was entailed , in default of heirs male  on a distant relation ; and their father 's fortune , though ample for him situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of her . His  father had been an attorney in Meryton , and had left him four thousand pounds . He had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips , who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business their father and succeeded him in the business him in the business , and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade . The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton ; a most convenient distance for the young gentlemen , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner 's shop just over the way . The two youngest of the family the family , Constance and Luke , were particularly frequent in these attentions ; their minds were more vacant than their brothers ' , and when nothing better offered , a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening ; and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt .
At present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood ; it was to remain the whole winter , and Meryton was the headquarters . Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence .
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers ' names and connections . Their Their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves . Mr. Phillips visited them all , and this opened to his his nieces a store of felicity unknown before . They could talk of nothing but officers ; and Miss Bingley 's large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their father , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign .
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , Mrs. Bennet coolly observed : `` From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest boys in the country  .
I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . '' Constance was disconcerted , and made no answer ; but Luke , with perfect indifference , continued to express him admiration of Captain Carter , and him hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to London .
`` I am astonished , my dear , '' said Mr. Bennet , `` that you should be so ready to think your your own children silly .
If I wished to think slightingly of anybody 's children , it should not be of my own , however . ''
`` If my children are silly , I must hope to be always sensible of it . ''
`` Yes -- but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . ''
`` This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree .
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest sons uncommonly foolish . ''
`` My My dear Mrs. Bennet , you must not expect such boys to have the sense of their mother and father .
When they get to our age , I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do .
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and , indeed , so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my boys I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his his regimentals . ''
`` Mamma , '' cried Luke , `` my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke Clarke 's library . '' Mr. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Mr. Bennet ; it came from Netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer . Mr. Bennet 's eyes sparkled with pleasure , and he was eagerly calling out , while his  son read , `` Well , John , who is it from ?
What is it about ?
What does she say ?
Well , John , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . ''
`` It is from Miss Bingley , '' said John , and then read it aloud .
`` MY DEAR FRIEND , -- `` If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's _ tête-à-tête _ between two women can never end without a quarrel .
Come as soon as you can on receipt of this . My My sister and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers .
-- Yours ever , `` CAROLINE BINGLEY '' `` With the officers ! '' cried Luke .
`` I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . ''
`` Dining out , '' said Mr. Bennet , `` that is very unlucky . ''
`` Can I have the carriage ? '' said John .
`` No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . ''
`` That would be a good scheme , '' said Edward , `` if you were sure that they would not offer to send him e . ''
`` Oh !
but the gentlemen will have Miss Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton , and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . ''
`` I had much rather go in the coach . ''
`` But , my dear , your your mother can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mrs. Bennet , are they not ? ''
`` They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . ''
`` But if you have got them to-day , '' said Edward , `` my father 's purpose will be answered . '' He did at last extort from his  mother an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged . John was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and his  father attended him to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day . His hopes were answered ; John had not been gone long before it rained hard . His  brothers were uneasy for him , but his  father was delighted .
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission ; John certainly could not come back .
`` This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! '' said Mr. Bennet more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all him own .
Till the next morning , however , he was not aware of all the felicity of him contrivance .
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield Netherfield brought the following note for Edward : `` MY DEAREST LIZZY , -- `` I find myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and , excepting a sore throat and headache , there is not much the matter with me .
-- Yours , etc. '' `` Well , my dear , '' said Mrs. Bennet , when Edward had read the note aloud , `` if your your son should have a dangerous fit of illness -- if he should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Miss Bingley , and under your orders . ''
`` Oh !
I am not afraid of him dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . He will be taken good care of .
As long as he stays there , it is all very well .
I would go and see him if I could have the carriage . '' Edward , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to him , though the carriage was not to be had ; and as he was no horseman , walking was him only alternative . He declared him resolution .
`` How can you be so silly , '' cried his  father , `` as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . ''
`` I shall be very fit to see John -- which is all I want . ''
`` Is this a hint to me , Eddie , '' said his  mother , `` to send for the horses ? ''
`` No , indeed , I do not wish to avoid the walk .
The distance is nothing when one has a motive ; only three miles .
I shall be back by dinner . ''
`` I admire the activity of your benevolence , '' observed Morris , `` but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . ''
`` We will go as far as Meryton with you , '' said Constance and Luke . Edward accepted their company , and the three young gentlemen set off together .
`` If we make haste , '' said Luke , as they walked along , `` perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . ''
In Meryton they parted ; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers ' wives the officers ' wives , and Edward continued him walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding himself at last within view of the house , with weary ankles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise . He was shown into the breakfast-parlour , where all but John were assembled , and where him appearance created a great deal of surprise .
That he should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by himself , was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley ; and Edward was convinced that they held him in contempt for it . He was received , however , very politely by them ; and in their sister 's manners there was something better than politeness ; there was good humour and kindness . Miss Darcy said very little , and Mr. Hurst nothing at all .
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to him complexion , and doubt as to the occasion 's justifying him coming so far alone .
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast . His inquiries after his  brother were not very favourably answered . Mr. Bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish , and not well enough to leave his  room . Edward was glad to be taken to him immediately ; and John , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in him note how much he longed for such a visit , was delighted at him entrance . He was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when Miss Bingley left them together , could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness he was treated with . Edward silently attended him .
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters ; and Edward began to like them himself , when he saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for John . The apothecary came , and having examined his his patient , said , as might be supposed , that he had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it ; advised him to return to bed , and promised him some draughts .
The advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and him head ached acutely . Edward did not quit his  room for a moment ; nor were the other ladies often absent ; the gentlemen being out , they had , in fact , nothing to do elsewhere .
When the clock struck three , Edward felt that he must go , and very unwillingly said so . Miss Bingley offered him  carriage , and he only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when John testified such concern in parting with him , that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present . Edward most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with him stay and bring back a supply of clothes .
