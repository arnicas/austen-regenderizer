Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner , Edward ran up to his  brother , and seeing him well guarded from cold , attended him into the drawing-room , where he was welcomed by his  two friends with many professions of pleasure ; and Edward had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared . Their powers of conversation were considerable .
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit .
But when the gentlemen entered , John was no longer the first object ; Miss Bingley 's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy , and she had something to say to her before she had advanced many steps . She addressed herself to Mr. Bennet , with a polite congratulation ; Mr. Hurst also made him a slight bow , and said he was `` very glad ; '' but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley 's salutation . She was full of joy and attention .
The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest he should suffer from the change of room ; and he removed at her desire to the other side of the fireplace , that he might be further from the door . She then sat down by him , and talked scarcely to anyone else . Edward , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight .
When tea was over , Mr. Hurst reminded his his sister-in-law of the card-table -- but in vain . She had obtained private intelligence that Miss Darcy did not wish for cards ; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected . She assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her . Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep . Darcy took up a book ; Miss Bingley did the same ; and Mrs. Hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her her sister 's conversation with Mr. Bennet . Miss Bingley 's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Miss Darcy 's progress through _ her _ book , as in reading her own ; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at her page . She could not win her , however , to any conversation ; she merely answered her question , and read on .
At length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of her , she gave a great yawn and said , `` How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way !
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading !
How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book !
When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . '' No one made any reply . She then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement ; when hearing her her sister mentioning a ball to Mr. Bennet , she turned suddenly towards her and said : `` By the bye , Charlotte , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield ?
I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . ''
`` If you mean Darcy , '' cried her her sister , `` she may go to bed , if she chooses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough , I shall send round my cards . ''
`` I should like balls infinitely better , '' she replied , `` if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting .
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day . ''
`` Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . '' Miss Bingley made no answer , and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room . Her figure was elegant , and she walked well ; but Darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious .
In the desperation of her feelings , she resolved on one effort more , and , turning to Edward , said : `` Miss Ed Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room .
I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . '' Edward was surprised , but agreed to it immediately . Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility ; Miss Darcy looked up . She was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Edward  could be , and unconsciously closed her book . She was directly invited to join their party , but she declined it , observing that she could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives her joining them would interfere .
`` What could she mean ? She was dying to know what could be her meaning ? ''
-- and asked Edward whether he could at all understand her ?
`` Not at all , '' was him answer ; `` but depend upon it , she means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing her will be to ask nothing about it . '' Miss Bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing Miss Darcy in anything , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of her two motives .
`` I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , '' said she , as soon as she allowed her to speak .
`` You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence , and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking ; if the first , I would be completely in your way , and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . ''
`` Oh !
shocking ! '' cried Miss Bingley .
`` I never heard anything so abominable .
How shall we punish her for such a speech ? ''
`` Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , '' said Edward .
`` We can all plague and punish one another .
Tease her -- laugh at her .
Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . ''
`` But upon my honour , I do _ not _ .
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ .
Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind !
No , no ; I feel she may defy us there .
And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Miss Darcy may hug herself . ''
`` Miss Darcy is not to be laughed at ! '' cried Edward .
`` That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintances .
I dearly love a laugh . ''
`` Miss Bingley , '' said she , `` has given me more credit than can be . The wisest and the best of women -- nay , the wisest and best of their actions -- may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . ''
`` Certainly , '' replied Edward -- `` there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ .
I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good .
Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies , _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can .
But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . ''
`` Perhaps that is not possible for anyone .
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . ''
`` Such as vanity and pride . ''
`` Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed .
But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . '' Edward turned away to hide a smile .
`` Your examination of Miss Darcy is over , I presume , '' said Miss Bingley ; `` and pray what is the result ? ''
`` I am perfectly convinced by it that Miss Darcy has no defect . She owns it herself without disguise . ''
`` No , '' said Darcy , `` I have made no such pretension .
I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding .
My temper I dare not vouch for .
It is , I believe , too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world .
I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offenses against myself .
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them .
My temper would perhaps be called resentful .
My good opinion once lost , is lost forever . ''
`` _ That _ is a failing indeed ! '' cried Edward .
`` Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character .
But you have chosen your fault well .
I really can not _ laugh _ at it .
You are safe from me . ''
`` There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil -- a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . ''
`` And _ your _ defect is to hate everybody . ''
`` And yours , '' she replied with a smile , `` is willfully to misunderstand them . ''
`` Do let us have a little music , '' cried Miss Bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share .
`` Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst ? '' Her Her sister had not the smallest objection , and the pianoforte was opened ; and Darcy , after a few moments ' recollection , was not sorry for it . She began to feel the danger of paying Edward too much attention .
