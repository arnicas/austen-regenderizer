Chapter 21

The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Edward had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of his father.
As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid him, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to him, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her her friend.
The morrow produced no abatement of Mr. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Edward had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
After breakfast, the boys walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their uncle's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over.
To Edward, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet Miss Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with her for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself." He highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to him. His accompanying them was a double advantage; he felt all the compliment it offered to himself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to his mother and father.
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Mr. Bennet; it came from Netherfield.
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Edward saw his brother's countenance change as he read it, and saw him dwelling intently on some particular passages. John recollected himself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with him usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Edward felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off him attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his his companion taken leave, than a glance from John invited him to follow him up stairs.
When they had gained their own room, John, taking out the letter, said: "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town -- and without any intention of coming back again.
You shall hear what she says." He then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their sister to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst Mr. Hurst had a house a house.
The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.
I depend on you for that."
To these highflown expressions Edward listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised him, he saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Miss Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, he was persuaded that John must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of her.
"It is unlucky," said he, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Miss Bingley will not be detained in London by them." "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.
I will read it to you:" "When my sister left us yesterday, she imagined that the business which took her to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it can not be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charlotte gets to town she will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following her thither, that she may not be obliged to spend her vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd -- but of that I despair.
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."
"It is evident by this," added John, "that she comes back no more this winter."
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that she should."
"Why will you think so?
It must be her own doing. She is her own mistress.
But you do not know all.
I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me.
I will have no reserves from you."
"Miss Darcy is impatient to see her sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again.
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My sister admires her greatly already; she will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her her relations all wish the connection as much as her own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charlotte most capable of engaging any woman's heart.
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest John, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"
"What do you think of this sentence, my dear Eddie?" said John as he finished it.
"Is it not clear enough?
Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her her brother; that she is perfectly convinced of her her sister's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for her, she means  most kindly! 
to put me on my guard?
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.
Will you hear it?"
"Most willingly."
"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her her sister is in love with you, and wants her to marry Miss Darcy. She follows her to town in hope of keeping her there, and tries to persuade you that she does not care about you." John shook him head.
"Indeed, John, you ought to believe me.
No one who has ever seen you together can doubt her affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, can not. She is not such a simpleton.
Could she have seen half as much love in Miss Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.
But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her her sister, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.
But, my dearest John, you can not seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her her sister greatly admires Miss Darcy, she is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when she took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade her that, instead of being in love with you, she is very much in love with her her friend."
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied John, "your representation of all this might make me quite easy.
But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself."
"That is right.
You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.
Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."
"But, my dear brother, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing her to marry elsewhere and friends are all wishing her to marry elsewhere?"
"You must decide for yourself," said Edward; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging her two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being her husband, I advise you by all means to refuse her."
"How can you talk so?" said John, faintly smiling.
"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."
"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I can not consider your situation with much compassion."
"But if she returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.
A thousand things may arise in six months!"
The idea of her returning no more Edward treated with the utmost contempt.
It appeared to him merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and he could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young woman so totally independent of everyone. He represented to his brother as forcibly as possible what he felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. John's temper was not desponding, and he was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of him heart.
They agreed that Mr. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the lady's conduct; but even this partial communication gave him a great deal of concern, and he bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.
After lamenting it, however, at some length, he had the consolation that Miss Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though she had been invited only to a family dinner, he would take care to have two full courses.
