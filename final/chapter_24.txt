Chapter 25

After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their mother another letter of thanks.
On the following Monday, Mr. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving his brother and his his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his his brother, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her her Longbourn nieces.
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.
When this was done she had a less active part to play.
It became her turn to listen. Mr. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.
They had all been very ill-used since he last saw his sister. Two of him her boys had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.
"I do not blame John," he continued, "for John would have got Miss Bingley if he could.
But Eddie!
Oh, sister!
It is very hard to think that he might have been Mr. Collins Mr. Collins's husband by this time, had it not been for him own perverseness. He made him an offer in this very room, and he refused him.
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.
They are all for what they can get.
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves." Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of John and Edward's correspondence with her, made her her brother a slight answer, and, in compassion to her her nieces, turned the conversation.
When alone with Edward afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for John," said she.
"I am sorry it went off.
But these things happen so often! A young woman, such as you describe Miss Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets him, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."
"An excellent consolation in its way," said Edward, "but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident.
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young woman of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before she was violently in love with only a few days before."
"But that expression of ` violently in love ' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.
Pray, how violent was Miss Bingley's love?"
"I never saw a more promising inclination; she was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by him.
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.
At her own ball she offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to her twice myself, without receiving an answer.
Could there be finer symptoms?
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"
"Oh, yes!
-- of that kind of love which I suppose her to have felt. Poor John!
I am sorry for him, because, with him disposition, he may not get over it immediately.
It had better have happened to you, Eddie; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.
But do you think he would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything." Edward was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of his brother's ready acquiescence.
"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young lady will influence him. We live in so different a part of town town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless she really comes to see him."
"And that is quite impossible; for she is now in the custody of her friend, and Miss Darcy would no more suffer her to call on John in such a part of London London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Miss Darcy may perhaps have heard of such such a place as Gracechurch Street a place as Gracechurch Street, but she would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse her from its impurities, were she once to enter it; and depend upon it, Miss Bingley never stirs without her."
"So much the better.
I hope they will not meet at all.
But does not John correspond with her sister?
She will not be able to help calling."
"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."
But in spite of the certainty in which Edward affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing John, he felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced him, on examination, that he did not consider it entirely hopeless.
It was possible, and sometimes he thought it probable, that her affection might be reanimated, and the influence of her friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of John's attractions. Mr. Bennet accepted his aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in him thoughts at the same time, than as he hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her her sister, he might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing her. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mr. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of his brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers the officers always made part of it -- of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Edward's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Edward on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to him the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged Derbyshire to which he belonged.
They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring. Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that lady's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
