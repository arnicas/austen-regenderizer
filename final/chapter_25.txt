Chapter 26

Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Edward was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to him alone; after honestly telling him what she thought, she thus went on: "You are too sensible a boy, Eddie, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.
Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.
But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you.
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your mother would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure.
You must not disappoint your mother."
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."
"Edward, you are not serious now."
"I beg your pardon, I will try again.
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not.
I see the imprudence of it.
Oh!
that abominable Mr. Darcy! My mother's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My mother, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.
In short, I will do my best."
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often.
At least, you should not remind your father of inviting him."
"As I did the other day," said Edward with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that.
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.
You know my father's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for his friends.
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied." His aunt assured him that she was, and Edward having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented. Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and John; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mr. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and he was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that he "wished they might be happy."
Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Edward, ashamed of his father's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected himself, accompanied her out of the room.
As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Ed."
"That you certainly shall."
"And I have another favour to ask you.
Will you come and see me?"
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford." Edward could not refuse, though he foresaw little pleasure in the visit.
"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.
Indeed, Ed, you will be as welcome as either of them."
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Edward soon heard from his friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Edward could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Edward felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as he might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Edward perceived that he must wait for him own visit there to know the rest. John had already written a few lines to his brother to announce their safe arrival in London; and when he wrote again, Edward hoped it would be in him power to say something of the Bingleys. His impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. John had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. He accounted for it, however, by supposing that him last letter to his friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.
"My aunt," he continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street." He wrote again when the visit was paid, and he had seen Miss Bingley.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were him words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.
I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her.
I inquired after their sister, of course. She was well, but so much engaged with Miss Darcy that they scarcely ever saw her.
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.
I wish I could see her.
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out.
I dare say I shall see them soon here." Edward shook him head over this letter.
It convinced him that accident only could discover to Miss Bingley brother's being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and John saw nothing of her. He endeavoured to persuade himself that he did not regret it; but he could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow John to deceive himself no longer.
The letter which he wrote on this occasion to his brother will prove what he felt.
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in him better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.
But, my dear brother, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.
I pity, though I can not help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side.
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her her sister is the cause of it.
I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as she is to her sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on her behalf is natural and amiable.
I can not but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if she had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. She knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that she is really partial to Miss Darcy.
I can not understand it.
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy -- your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.
Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of her never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it.
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford Hunsford.
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.
-- Yours, etc." This letter gave Edward some pain; but him spirits returned as he considered that John would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the sister was now absolutely over. He would not even wish for a renewal of her attentions. Her character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for her, as well as a possible advantage to John, he seriously hoped she might really soon marry Miss Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make her abundantly regret what she had thrown away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Edward of him promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Edward had such to send as might rather give contentment to his aunt than to himself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Edward was watchful enough to see it all, but he could see it and write of it without material pain. His heart had been but slightly touched, and him vanity was satisfied with believing that he would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Edward, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish him, he was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, he thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.
But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King.
I can not find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.
There can be no love in all this.
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Connie and Luke take his defection much more to heart than I do.
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."
